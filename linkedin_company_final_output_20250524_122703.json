Lots more coming.\n\n- [Shown in video] Reworked environment page to make it easier to set up code execution.\n\n- Added a button to retry failed tasks.\n- Added indicators to show that the agent runs without network access after setup.\n- Added options to copy git patches after pushing a PR.\n- Added support for unicode branch names.\n- Fixed a bug where secrets were not piped to the setup script.\n- Fixed creating branches when there’s a branch name conflict.\n- Fixed rendering diffs with multi-character emojis.\n- Improved error messages when starting tasks, running setup scripts, pushing PRs, or when disconnected from GitHub, to be more specific and indicate how to resolve the error.\n- Improved onboarding for teams.\n- Polished how new tasks look while loading.\n- Polished the followup composer.\n- Reduced GitHub disconnects by 90%.\n- Reduced PR creation latency by 35%.\n- Reduced task completion latency by 20%.\n- Reduced tool call latency by 50%.\n- Started setting page titles to task titles so Codex tabs are easier to tell apart.\n- Tweaked the system prompt so that agent knows it’s working without network, and can suggest that the user set up dependencies.\n- Updated the docs.\n\nTracking this all in the Codex Changelog: https://lnkd.in/e2-7naRj",

I checked in two bug fixes earlier this week, written by Codex while I did other work.\n\nCodex will roll out to Pro, Enterprise and Teams users over the next few days, and more broadly in the coming weeks.\n\nIt's a new way of building software, and it should allow far more people to build than ever before 🙌\n\nMore info at https://lnkd.in/gnB3qjt2",
